Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
One problem is involving a thermostat like control set up where you can control the temperature setting with the two buttons on our microcontroller, and also read the rooms temperature and have our LED tell us whether the heat is on or off. I also added some code from a prior assignment that was a building block to this. This inital project shows the utilization of keyboard input to control my LED light turning off and on, which was a major part in the thermostat project.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I followed the project guidelines really well and inlcuded all the required functionality.

Where could you improve?

I believe the speed in which I come up with a solution could be vastly improved. I take a very long time coming up with a way to solve some problems which is due to me not having repition with said code

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The tools I will be adding to my support network 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skills with utilizing microcontrollers will transfer vary well into other projects because it was problem solving at the end of the day. Any time you are critcal thinking it can help you in general when using that skill again in the future.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Ensure that I follow the principle of making my code modular in nature. This is essential to ensuring our code has those three traits.
